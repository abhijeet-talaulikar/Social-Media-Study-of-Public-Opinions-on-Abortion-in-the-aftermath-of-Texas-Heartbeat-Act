## Social Media Study of Public Opinions on Abortion in the aftermath of Texas Heartbeat Act

Our study aims to gauge the public opinion on the law and thereby providing commentary into its political feasibility. We study the opinions of Twitter users across 30 states in the United States who actively tweeted during the commencement of the law and make three major contributions. 

(1) Using the publicly available self-disclosed information of Twitter users, our study analyzes the participation patterns in the movement; 
(2) We identify major topics in discussions; 
(3) Using BERT and a stacking model we predict public opinion on the divisive law and find that the movement varies across user characteristics. We show that the public opinion slants overwhelmingly negatively apropos the law. 

To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media study to understand public opinion on SB8.
